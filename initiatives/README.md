# The WP Community Collective Initiatives Program

This repository folder manages The WP Community Collective’s Initiatives.

Initiatives are community-building programs and strategic actions that support The WPCC’s mission and values. Focuses include accessibility, inclusion, governance, transparency, mentorship, and other long-term open source community priorities. These efforts are designed to complement our direct funding programs by investing in systems, relationships, and practices that strengthen open source communities and support open source contributors.
