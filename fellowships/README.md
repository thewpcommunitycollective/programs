# The WPCC Fellowships Program

This repository folder manages the development and administration of The WP Community Collective’s Fellowships Program. Fellowships provide financial and structural support to contributors working in focused areas that serve the long-term sustainability and health of the open source ecosystem.

The Fellowships Program is designed to support independent, mission-aligned work that advances community needs, fills critical contribution gaps, and aligns with The WPCC’s values of transparency, accessibility, and accountability.
